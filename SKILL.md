# mitmproxy-mcp

HTTP/HTTPS traffic analysis, interception, and replay through mitmproxy.

## Prerequisites

- mitmproxy running with the mitmproxy-mcp addon loaded
- MCP server available at `http://localhost:9011/sse` (SSE transport)

If the MCP server is not connected, tell the user to start mitmproxy first:

```bash
mitmproxy      # or mitmweb, or mitmdump
```

The addon and MCP server start automatically if configured in `~/.mitmproxy/config.yaml`.

## When to Use This Skill

- User asks to inspect, debug, or analyze HTTP traffic
- User wants to replay or modify an HTTP request
- User wants to intercept requests matching a pattern
- User needs to export captured traffic (HAR format)
- User is doing API debugging or security testing

## Available Tools (20)

### Flow Tools -- querying captured traffic

- `get_flows` -- list captured flows with optional filtering by method, URL pattern, or status code. Supports `limit` and `offset` for pagination.
- `get_flow_by_id` -- get full request and response details for a single flow
- `search_flows` -- search flows by regex pattern across URL, method, status, and headers
- `get_flow_request` -- get only the request portion of a flow
- `get_flow_response` -- get only the response portion of a flow
- `get_flow_count` -- count of currently stored flows
- `clear_flows` -- clear all stored flows
- `export_flows` -- export flows to HAR 1.2 format. Optionally pass specific flow IDs.

### Replay Tools -- sending and modifying requests

- `replay_request` -- replay a captured request exactly as-is. Returns a new flow with the response.
- `send_request` -- send a new HTTP request. Parameters: `url` (required), `method` (default GET), `headers`, `body`.
- `modify_and_send` -- take an existing flow, change its method/url/headers/body, and send it. Useful for testing variations.
- `duplicate_flow` -- clone a flow without sending it. Useful for before/after comparisons.

### Intercept Tools -- pausing and controlling live traffic

- `set_intercept_filter` -- set a mitmproxy filter expression to intercept matching requests. Uses mitmproxy filter syntax: `~u example.com`, `~m POST`, `~u api & ~m GET`. Pass empty string to disable.
- `get_intercepted_flows` -- list flows currently paused by interception
- `resume_flow` -- resume a single intercepted flow
- `resume_all` -- resume all intercepted flows
- `drop_flow` -- drop/kill an intercepted flow without forwarding it

### Config Tools -- proxy settings

- `get_options` -- get current mitmproxy option values. Pass specific keys or get curated defaults.
- `set_option` -- set a mitmproxy option at runtime. Some dangerous options (listen_host, listen_port, mode, server, ssl_insecure) are blocked.
- `get_status` -- get proxy status: version, listen address, mode, flow count, intercept settings.

## Workflow Patterns

### Basic traffic inspection

1. Make sure mitmproxy is running and proxying the target traffic
2. Use `get_flows` to see what has been captured
3. Use `get_flow_by_id` to drill into specific requests/responses
4. Use `search_flows` with a regex to find specific patterns

### Replaying and modifying requests

1. Find the flow you want with `get_flows` or `search_flows`
2. Use `replay_request` to resend it exactly
3. Or use `modify_and_send` to change headers, body, or URL before sending
4. Compare the original and modified responses

### Intercepting live traffic

1. Set a filter with `set_intercept_filter` (e.g. `~u api.example.com & ~m POST`)
2. Wait for matching requests -- they will be paused
3. Use `get_intercepted_flows` to see what is waiting
4. Use `resume_flow` or `drop_flow` to control each one
5. Use `set_intercept_filter` with empty string to stop intercepting

## Important Notes

- Sensitive data (tokens, passwords, API keys, JWTs) is automatically redacted in tool responses
- Request/response bodies are truncated to 10KB to prevent context overflow
- All data is in-memory only -- cleared when mitmproxy stops
- The proxy stores up to 1000 flows by default (oldest evicted first)
